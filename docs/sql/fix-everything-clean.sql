-- CLEAN FIX - HANDLES EXISTING POLICIES
-- Copy and paste this entire script into Supabase SQL editor
-- ===================================================================

-- STEP 1: Check current data
SELECT 'BEFORE FIX:' as status;
SELECT 'Users in auth.users:' as check1, COUNT(*) as count FROM auth.users;
SELECT 'Users in user_profiles:' as check2, COUNT(*) as count FROM public.user_profiles;

-- STEP 2: Create missing user profiles
INSERT INTO public.user_profiles (id, email, full_name, phone_number, company_name)
SELECT 
    au.id,
    au.email,
    COALESCE(au.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', 'Unknown User') as full_name,
    COALESCE(au.raw_user_meta_data->>'phone_number', '') as phone_number,
    COALESCE(au.raw_user_meta_data->>'company_name', '') as company_name
FROM auth.users au
LEFT JOIN public.user_profiles up ON au.id = up.id
WHERE up.id IS NULL;

-- STEP 3: Fix storage policies (clean approach)
DO $$ 
BEGIN
    -- Drop existing storage policies
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view community files" ON storage.objects;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can upload files" ON storage.objects;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can update files" ON storage.objects;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can delete files" ON storage.objects;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public access to community files" ON storage.objects;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated uploads to community files" ON storage.objects;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated updates to community files" ON storage.objects;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated deletes to community files" ON storage.objects;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all access to community files" ON storage.objects;
    
    -- Create new storage policy
    CREATE POLICY "Allow all access to community files" ON storage.objects
    FOR ALL USING (bucket_id = 'community-files');
    
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
        RAISE NOTICE 'Storage policies already handled';
END $$;

-- STEP 4: Grant all permissions
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA public TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON storage.objects TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON storage.buckets TO authenticated;

-- STEP 5: Verify everything is fixed
SELECT 'AFTER FIX:' as status;
SELECT 'Users in auth.users:' as check1, COUNT(*) as count FROM auth.users;
SELECT 'Users in user_profiles:' as check2, COUNT(*) as count FROM public.user_profiles;
SELECT 'Events:' as check3, COUNT(*) as count FROM public.community_events;
SELECT 'Resources:' as check4, COUNT(*) as count FROM public.community_resources;

SELECT 'EVERYTHING FIXED! âœ…' as final_status;
